One study found that the average person checks their smartphone over 85 times per day, and spends more than five hours browsing the web and using apps. Hilariously, people check their phones more than twice as much as they think they do. Thus, more often than not, people are unconsciously triggered to check their smartphones.

### Android Dashboard, Shush mode, and App Timers will help you take charge of your ‘Digital Wellbeing’
  On stage at Google I/O 2018, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai introduced a new feature called Android Dashboard. The purpose of Android Dashboard is to help you get a hold on your “digital wellbeing,” otherwise known as how much time you’re spending on your phone.
  Using Android Dashboard, you’ll be able to see exactly how you’re spending your time on your phone, including what apps you use the most. It will also tell you how many times you’ve unlocked your phone and how many notifications you’ve received.

### Apple's "Digital Health" iOS 12 will reportedly show how much time you’re spending on your iPhone
  According to Bloomberg, as part of Apple’s iOS 12 reveal on Monday, the company will introduce a “Digital Health” area of the settings menu. Much like Google’s coming effort, it will include “a series of tools” that will outline how we’re spending our time on iPhones and iPads. 
  There are already ways to do some of this today: for example, you can go into your iPhone’s battery settings and tap on apps to see how long they’ve been on-screen. But putting all of that data together in a central location is a better, more helpful experience for users.
